##Catalyst Day 4
Exploring the form of spacial agency- formally expressing spacial agency
We started talking about similar affordances/agencies instead of similar spaces
Affordances (Actions) of facades
What actions do facades afford
* Barriers
	* Shelter
	* Separating
	* As framing (leading vs complete openess)
* Movement along
* Movement through
* CV also negates actual/physical affordances through creating new afforadances 
* CV can reveal and make apparent these affordances

What's Sticking
* Ways of representing different traversals of the same space
--- expressing traversals
* Abstract but concrete "actions", designing for affordances- how facades allow for these affordances- how cv and human understand these
--- design for affordances
--- expressing how humans and computers understand space together
--- the affordances of space (not just objects)
* Facade as sequence and cv vision
* Movement as form of the space
* Blurring bounderies between nature and artifice

So... (FOCUS)
* traversal (Dustin, Sam, George)
* affordance (of space) (Shane, Chris)
* blur + equality (Erika, Jeremey)
* duplication

Issues
* Why build a physical model?
* Spectrum of representation + speculation
* What (practical + conceptual) insights into facades does cv can give us
* Decimations vs drippiness- organic vs analytical
* manual and automated
* What role does movement play in the process? To what extent are the models about movement? About vision?

Important Commands
* ExtractUVmesh- flattens mesh


##Catalyst Day 3
Human computer vision as a collage
It confuses the boundries
Human computer seems to become organic

3 ways to proceed
* All model same space- entrance
	* Pillsbury Hall and the Rec Center, I did 2 sets on both- one of approach and one walking by
* Each pursue own direction
* Replace our human bias with a bot

Thoughts
* The way bodily movement and placement can affect computer vision
* Frustrating in what the computer dismisses when pictures are not taken systematicly
* Doesn't work to go back and add photos to a set- interesting in humans understanding building off previous experiences, cv just and solo understanding
* Even as abstract these outputs are- none are just pure abstraction but fundementally based on space and our actual understanding


##Catalyst Day 2
* CV way of seeing soooo different- not just a better way we see. Not wrong but difficult to understand and find the value. 
* manual vs automation
* when buildings look like renderings- buildings "automating" design process
* degree of mediation between manual and automation or cv and human
So what's the question:
* Is it about wrappers
* Depth? 
* Whole problem with non-reality
* How the new aesthetic can become more organic instead rational or discrete

####Mediating CV/Automated and Human/Manual
Thinking in certain ways in order to mediate human understanding and computer understanding, or bike understanding. 
loading1= loading dock- 1 picture every 6 steps all the way around
loading2= loading dock- whatever I wanted
loading3= loading dock- like a bike- all pictures just on path and limited number
loading4= loading dock- all pictures from building across the street 'student view'
civil1= civil engineering building- 1 picture every 6 steps half way around
civil2= civil engineering building- whatever I wanted
civil3= civil engineering building- like a bike- all pictures on path in direct line and limited number
shop1= physics and nano mechanical shop- 1 picture every 6 steps all the way around
shop2= physics and nano mechanical shop- whatever I wanted


##Catalyst Day 1
#####Initial Ideas
* Thresholds- analyzing typologies of a city, whether scale, materiality, reflectivity, etc.
* Perceptual contours- analyze for patterns, glitches/intentially/confusing photograhmetry
* Crowd sourcing photos for a building, how facebook or instagram or flickr understand certain buildings. Similarily how academic journals understand the same ones.
* Creating a eiggn face for buildings and then applying that to a conceptual model like an ice cube.
