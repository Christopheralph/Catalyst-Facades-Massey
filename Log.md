##Catalyst Day 3
Human computer vision as a collage
It confuses the boundries
Human computer seems to become organic

3 ways to proceed
* All model same space- entrance
	* Pillsbury Hall and the Rec Center, I did 2 sets on both- one of approach and one walking by
* Each pursue own direction
* Replace our human bias with a bot

Thoughts
* The way bodily movement and placement can affect computer vision
* Frustrating in what the computer dismisses when pictures are not taken systematicly
* Doesn't work to go back and add photos to a set- interesting in humans understanding building off previous experiences, cv just and solo understanding
* Even as abstract these outputs are- none are just pure abstraction but fundementally based on space and our actual understanding


##Catalyst Day 2
* CV way of seeing soooo different- not just a better way we see. Not wrong but difficult to understand and find the value. 
* manual vs automation
* when buildings look like renderings- buildings "automating" desgin process
* degree of mediation between manual and automation or cv and human
So what's the question:
* Is it about wrappers
* Depth? 
* Whole problem with non-reality
* How the new aesthetic can become more organic instead rational or discrete

####Mediating CV/Automated and Human/Manual
Thinking in certain ways in order to mediate human understanding and computer understanding, or bike understanding. 
loading1= loading dock- 1 picture every 6 steps all the way around
loading2= loading dock- whatever I wanted
loading3= loading dock- like a bike- all pictures just on path and limited number
loading4= loading dock- all pictures from building across the street 'student view'
civil1= civil engineering building- 1 picture every 6 steps half way around
civil2= civil engineering building- whatever I wanted
civil3= civil engineering building- like a bike- all pictures on path in direct line and limited number
shop1= physics and nano mechanical shop- 1 picture every 6 steps all the way around
shop2= physics and nano mechanical shop- whatever I wanted


##Catalyst Day 1
#####Initial Ideas
* Thresholds- analyzing typologies of a city, whether scale, materiality, reflectivity, etc.
* Perceptual contours- analyze for patterns, glitches/intentially/confusing photograhmetry
* Crowd sourcing photos for a building, how facebook or instagram or flickr understand certain buildings. Similarily how academic journals understand the same ones.
* Creating a eiggn face for buildings and then applying that to a conceptual model like an ice cube.
