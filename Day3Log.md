We continued playing with photoscan and discovered the effect movement and bodily placement had on the computer's interpretation.

Here we see how the computer interpreted the movement of the camera, the blue squares. The pictures were taken while walking in a straight line at the same height but the computer thinks the camera jumped while moving forward and then crouched.

We also looked at the effect of pre-processing the images. Here the hue saturation is blown out but it does little to the formal interpretation of the model.

We also wanted to explore what effect a bot (the drone) had on the computers interpretation (we were looking for any excuse to fly the drone).
